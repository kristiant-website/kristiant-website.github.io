  aboutme_para1:
    "Kristian Talley began their professional artistic journey in Fine Arts from the Columbia Collage of Arts where I earned my qualification in Super Professional Diploma. Being a literature student helps a lot in defining art. Art is similar to poetry. Painting and poetry are similar in the way that they make â€œabsent things present",
  aboutme_para2:
